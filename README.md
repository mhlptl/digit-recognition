# Digit Recognition

This project uses Python 3.8 as its Python Interpreter.

The project utilizes the MNIST dataset to train and test a neural network to accurately predict the number that a user inputs in the Graphical User Interface (GUI). The GUI is built using Tkinter. The neural network was built using numpy.

Notes:

- GUI is built
- Back Propagation needs to be worked on
